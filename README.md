Project Title:

Classification by Decision Tree to Identify Most Suitable Crops for Certain Environment

Objective:
Using the programming language of your choice and using the dataset provided below to train a
Decision Tree in order to identify the best suitable crop for a given environment. The dataset
serves a reasonable training, testing and evaluation set as it contains 7 parameters representing
the climatic conditions for a large number of farms, and an output label for a particular crop
that suits each environment.

Use the 5-folds cross-validation procedure to validate your decision trees, in other words, you
need to redo the training process 5 times and then compare: Accuracy, Precision and Recall
between each iteration.

After training is complete, you need to build a platform that helps users enter the climatic
parameters for the real environments then apply them to the Decision Tree in order to
recommend the most suitable crop for that particular environment. Your program should also
present the final Decision Tree in a graph.

The Dataset:
The dataset provides real life data for a number of different farmlands, each labeled with the
most suitable crop to grow that suits that environment.

The Features included in the dataset:
Features (Inputs):
- N – Nitrogen content in the soil (in mg/kg)
- P – Phosphorus content in the soil (in mg/kg)
- K – Potassium content in the soil (in mg/kg)
- temperature – Average temperature in °C
- humidity – Average relative humidity in %
- ph – Soil pH value
- rainfall – Rainfall in mm
- 
Label (Output):
- label – The crop most suited to the given conditions (e.g., rice, maize, cotton, etc.)
